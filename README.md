## Sentiment Based Depression Detection In Tweets
# üß† Tweet Mood Classifier: Depression Detection using ML

## üìå Project Overview
This project aims to **analyze tweets and classify them as signs of depression or not** 
using various machine learning algorithms. Through extensive text preprocessing, feature extraction, 
and model comparison, it identifies the most effective classifier for sentiment-based mental health analysis.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Removal of usernames, links, special characters
   - Lowercasing, stopword removal, lemmatization

2. **Visualization**
   - Word clouds for general, happy, and depressed tweets *(optional)*

3. **Feature Extraction**
   - CountVectorizer (Bag of Words)

4. **Model Training & Evaluation**
   - Logistic Regression
   - Naive Bayes
   - K-Nearest Neighbors
   - Decision Tree
   - Random Forest
   - Support Vector Machine (Linear SVC)

5. **Model Comparison**
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix
   - ROC Curve
   - Accuracy Bar Chart
